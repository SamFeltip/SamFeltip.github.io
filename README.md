# Portfolio
## Welcome
Hi! I'm Sam, this is the git repository for my portfolio.

As well as a collection of some of my most interesting recent work, this site is a chance for me to show off some of my front end developing skills.

This site was built entirely from scratch, using only HTML, JS, and CSS. I've listed a few points of interest below.

## Navbar
The navigation on this site is responsive, meaning it minimises on mobile screens.

If you tap on the burger icon in the top right, you'll see a drop-down list of the pages of interest on this site. 

## Tabs
Visit `/pages/projects/planetGO.html` and see the three stages of development: planning, designing, and implementing. You can choose which section to view by clicking on the tabs below the header.

## Carousel
Visit `/pages/projects/planetGO.html` and check out the 'design' tab to see some mockups made for this project before development began. These are presented on a carousel - click the chevrons below the images to cycle through the images!

## Large images
Clicking on large images shows an expanded view of the image. pressing escape or clicking away dismisses the image.

## Dark theme
Adaptive theme to your system. Coming soon!

# Don't forget to inspect element!
This portfolio is as much a personal project as the content it hosts, so be nosy! press f12 on your keyboard to have a look at the HTML, CSS and JavaScript I've written for this portfolio.
